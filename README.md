This was our project at the PennApps hackathon in Spring 2013.

We use an iPhone as a "magic wand," which can be waved around to target visual and audio effects on participating computers.

It makes a bit more sense with a demo.

Directions To Give Everyone Else

  

1. Tell everyone to  
    1. turn up their volume to maximum 
    2. go to [bit.ly/magicwandapp](http://bit.ly/magicwandapp) 

2. Then mentally split the audience into 4 sections and tell section 1 that they are section 1, section 2 that they are section 2, etc. 
3. Tell everyone  
    1. to click the appropriate section button on their screen 
    2. tell them that their screen will then turn black 
    3. to turn their computers so that it faces a particular direction that everyone can now get up and move to (yes, people need to stand up and move). I've found that turning the computers so that they make a "U" like shape is helpful (like an [orchestra](http://i.imgur.com/GymupGM.png) or a [choir](http://i.imgur.com/zNtmTtG.png)). 

4. Pro Tip I 
    1. You can't leave the windows open too long after clicking what section they are in. The page will timeout and the page will need to be refreshed and you will need to start from step 1b again. 
    2. Sometimes the network you are on, particularly school networks will block websockets from being used. If it is blocking, you probably will see a javascript console error but it's always good to test it in an environment before doing demo. If the network doesn't cooperate, you can always try tethering to a phone to getting internet in these scenarios. 

  

Directions To Do Yourself

  

1. Go to [bit.ly/mctrl](http://bit.ly/mctrl) ("mctrl" standing for mobile control or controller) 
2. Calibrate The Phone ([follow directions here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11G5a3U-nAFLbiHP1JJXcli0ufH59l3xssegDVkp9qC4/edit?usp=sharing)) 
3. [The Remaining Directions are in this Video (which actually recaps points 1 and 2 as well)](http://youtu.be/CCfL4EFGsD8) 
  

Pro Tip

- Try practicing doing the above directions on your own computer except open up 4 four browser windows and pretend it is 4 different computers. Once you click on a section, it will fullscreenâ€”just unfullscreen it right afterwards to get it inside of a normal window.
